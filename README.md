## About Me

I'm currently studying Computer Science at Aarhus University, specializing in artificial intelligence and cryptology. I love getting hands-on with new technologies—whether that's building web apps, tinkering with backends, or just figuring out how things work. My favorite part? Diving deep into topics that catch my curiosity and learning as much as I can.

## Projects

Most of my projects are private for now, but here's a glimpse of what I've been working on:

  Full-stack application for media literacy education (private).  
  I handled everything from the user interface to the backend logic and integration.

I’m always working on something new—if you’re curious about my latest experiments, don’t hesitate to ask!
